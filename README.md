# ClockGlitching
Repository for Clock Glitching

Clock glitching is the act of switching a devices clock in hopes of causing it to perform in a way that was unintended. The most common use of the clock glitching is switching a devices clock to a much faster clock, from KHz to MHz and as a result the devices memory bus is then flooded and it may release very important information. For devices with very little security you can also skip instructions by inserting a fault at just the right time. 

There are two different types of clock fault injection synchronous and asynchronous.
